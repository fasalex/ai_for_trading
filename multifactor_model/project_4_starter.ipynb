    "## Instructions\n",
    "Each problem consists of a function to implement and instructions on how to implement the function.  The parts of the function that need to be implemented are marked with a `# TODO` comment. After implementing the function, run the cell to test it against the unit tests we've provided. For each problem, we provide one or more unit tests from our `project_tests` package. These unit tests won't tell you if your answer is correct, but will warn you of any major errors. Your code will be checked for the correct solution when you submit it to Udacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Packages\n",
    "When you implement the functions, you'll only need to you use the packages you've used in the classroom, like [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/). These packages will be imported for you. We recommend you don't add any import statements, otherwise the grader might not be able to run your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other packages that we're importing are `project_helper` and `project_tests`. These are custom packages built to help you solve the problems.  The `project_helper` module contains utility functions and graph functions. The `project_tests` contains the unit tests for all the problems.\n",

What is it about these alphas that leads to the highest ranking stocks in all alphas except MR 5D smoothed to *not* perform the best.\n",
    "- The majority of the return is coming from the **short side** in all these alphas. The negative return in quintile 1 is very large in all alphas. This could also a cause for concern becuase when you short stocks, you need to locate the short; shorts can be expensive or not available at all.\n",
    "- If you look at the magnitude of the return spread (i.e., Q1 minus Q5), we are working with daily returns in the 0.03%, i.e., **3 basis points**, neighborhood *before all transaction costs, shorting costs, etc.*. Assuming 252 days in a year, that's 7.56% return annualized. Transaction costs may cut this in half. As such, it should be clear that these alphas can only survive in an institutional setting and that leverage will likely need to be applied in order to achieve an attractive return.\n",
